# **📘 Detailed Notes on Inheritance in Java**  

## **🔹 What is Inheritance?**  
**Inheritance** is one of the key **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles** that allows a class (child) to acquire the properties and behaviors of another class (parent). It promotes **code reusability** and establishes a relationship between classes.  

### **🔹 Syntax of Inheritance**  
Inheritance is implemented using the **`extends`** keyword.  
```java
class Parent {
    // Parent class properties and methods
}
class Child extends Parent {
    // Child class inherits from Parent
}
```

---

## **🔹 Types of Inheritance in Java**  

### **1️⃣ Single Inheritance**  
➡ In **single inheritance**, a class inherits from one parent class.  
➡ The child class gains access to the properties and methods of the parent class.  

#### **📝 Example: Single Inheritance**
```java
class Animal {  
    void eat() {  
        System.out.println("This animal can eat.");  
    }  
}  

class Dog extends Animal {  
    void bark() {  
        System.out.println("The dog is barking.");  
    }  
}  

public class SingleInheritanceExample {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Dog d = new Dog();  
        d.eat();  // Inherited method from Animal class  
        d.bark(); // Method of Dog class  
    }  
}
```
**🔹 Output:**  
```
This animal can eat.  
The dog is barking.  
```

---

### **2️⃣ Multi-Level Inheritance**  
➡ In **multi-level inheritance**, a class inherits from another class, which itself is inherited from another class.  
➡ This creates a **chain of inheritance**.  

#### **📝 Example: Multi-Level Inheritance**
```java
class Animal {  
    void eat() {  
        System.out.println("This animal can eat.");  
    }  
}  

class Mammal extends Animal {  
    void walk() {  
        System.out.println("This mammal can walk.");  
    }  
}  

class Dog extends Mammal {  
    void bark() {  
        System.out.println("The dog is barking.");  
    }  
}  

public class MultiLevelInheritanceExample {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Dog d = new Dog();  
        d.eat();  // Inherited from Animal  
        d.walk(); // Inherited from Mammal  
        d.bark(); // Method of Dog class  
    }  
}
```
**🔹 Output:**  
```
This animal can eat.  
This mammal can walk.  
The dog is barking.  
```

### **3️⃣ Hierarchical Inheritance**  
➡ In **hierarchical inheritance**, **multiple child classes inherit from a single parent class**.  
➡ Each child class has access to the parent class properties but remains independent from other child classes.  

#### **📝 Example: Hierarchical Inheritance**
```java
class Vehicle {  
    void fuel() {  
        System.out.println("Vehicles need fuel to run.");  
    }  
}  

class Car extends Vehicle {  
    void fourWheeler() {  
        System.out.println("A car has four wheels.");  
    }  
}  

class Bike extends Vehicle {  
    void twoWheeler() {  
        System.out.println("A bike has two wheels.");  
    }  
}  

public class HierarchicalInheritanceExample {  
    public static void main(String[] args) {  
        Car c = new Car();  
        c.fuel();  // Inherited from Vehicle  
        c.fourWheeler(); // Method of Car class  

        Bike b = new Bike();  
        b.fuel();  // Inherited from Vehicle  
        b.twoWheeler(); // Method of Bike class  
    }  
}
```
**🔹 Output:**  
```
Vehicles need fuel to run.  
A car has four wheels.  
Vehicles need fuel to run.  
A bike has two wheels.  
```

## **🔍 Summary**  
✅ **Inheritance** enables a class to acquire properties and methods from another class, promoting **code reusability**.  
✅ **Types of Inheritance in Java:**  
1. **Single Inheritance** → One child class inherits from one parent.  
2. **Multi-Level Inheritance** → A chain of inheritance where a class is derived from another derived class.  
3. **Hierarchical Inheritance** → Multiple child classes inherit from the same parent class.

## **📌 Key Points for Exams**  
✔ **Inheritance is implemented using the `extends` keyword.**  
✔ **Single inheritance** is the simplest form, where a child class inherits from a single parent.  
✔ **Multi-level inheritance** creates a chain of inheritance.  
✔ **Hierarchical inheritance** has multiple child classes inheriting from the same parent.  
✔ **Java does NOT support multiple inheritance using classes** (to avoid ambiguity issues). Instead, **multiple inheritance is achieved using interfaces**.
