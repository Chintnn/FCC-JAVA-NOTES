# **📘 Detailed Notes on `abstract` Keyword in Java**  

The `abstract` keyword in Java is used to define **abstract classes and abstract methods**, which provide a blueprint for other classes to follow. Abstract classes **cannot be instantiated**, and abstract methods **must be implemented by subclasses**.  

---

## **🔹 1. Abstract Class in Java**  

An **abstract class** is a class that **cannot be instantiated** and may contain **abstract methods** (methods without implementation) as well as **concrete methods** (methods with implementation).  

### **📝 Example: Abstract Class**  
```java
abstract class Vehicle {  
    abstract void start();  // Abstract method (no body)

    void stop() {  // Concrete method (with body)
        System.out.println("Vehicle stopped.");
    }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {  
    void start() {  // Implementing abstract method
        System.out.println("Car starts with a key.");
    }
}

public class Main {  
    public static void main(String args[]) {  
        Car myCar = new Car();  
        myCar.start();  // Calls the overridden method
        myCar.stop();   // Calls the concrete method
    }  
}
```
**🔹 Output:**  
```
Car starts with a key.  
Vehicle stopped.  
```

### **⚠ Rules for Abstract Classes**  
✅ Cannot be instantiated directly.  
✅ Can have **both abstract and concrete methods**.  
✅ Can have **constructors**, but they can only be called by subclasses.  
✅ Can have instance variables and static methods.  

---

## **🔹 2. Abstract Methods in Java**  

An **abstract method** is a method that is **declared without an implementation** and **must be overridden** in subclasses.  

### **📝 Example: Abstract Method**  
```java
abstract class Animal {  
    abstract void makeSound();  // Abstract method (must be implemented by subclasses)
}

class Dog extends Animal {  
    void makeSound() {  
        System.out.println("Dog barks.");
    }  
}

public class Main {  
    public static void main(String args[]) {  
        Dog myDog = new Dog();  
        myDog.makeSound();
    }  
}
```
**🔹 Output:**  
```
Dog barks.  
```

### **⚠ Rules for Abstract Methods**  
✅ Must be defined inside an **abstract class**.  
✅ **Cannot have a body** (no implementation).  
✅ **Must be overridden** in subclasses.

## **🔹 3. Key Features of Abstract Classes & Methods**  
| Feature | Abstract Class | Abstract Method |
|---------|---------------|----------------|
| **Definition** | A class that cannot be instantiated, may contain abstract methods | A method without a body (implementation) |
| **Purpose** | Serves as a blueprint for subclasses | Ensures subclasses provide an implementation |
| **Concrete Methods** | Can have both abstract and concrete methods | Only exists in an abstract class |
| **Implementation** | Must be inherited by a subclass | Must be overridden in the subclass |
| **Instantiation** | Cannot be instantiated | Not applicable |

---

## **🔍 Summary**  
✅ **Abstract Classes** → Cannot be instantiated and may contain abstract methods.  
✅ **Abstract Methods** → Have no implementation and must be overridden in child classes.  
✅ Abstract classes can have **constructors, static methods, and instance variables**.  
✅ Subclasses of an abstract class **must** implement all abstract methods.

## **📌 Key Points for Exams**  
✔ An **abstract class can have both abstract and non-abstract methods**.  
✔ An **abstract method cannot have a body** and must be overridden in the subclass.  
✔ If a subclass does **not override all abstract methods**, it must also be declared `abstract`.  
✔ Abstract classes **can have constructors**, but they are called only when a subclass object is created.  
✔ **Interfaces** are similar to abstract classes but only allow method declarations (until Java 8 introduced default methods).
