## 🧠 Thread vs Process

| Feature      | Thread                                   | Process                             |
|--------------|------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|
| Definition   | Smallest unit of execution inside a process | Independent unit of execution        |
| Memory       | Shares memory with other threads in process | Each has its own memory space        |
| Communication| Easy (shared memory)                    | Complex (IPC - Inter-process Communication) |
| Creation     | Faster and lightweight                   | Slower and heavyweight              |
| Failure      | A thread crash can affect the whole process | Isolated from others                |
| Java Support | Full support via `Thread` class and `Runnable` | Limited to external processes using `ProcessBuilder` or `Runtime.exec()` |

## 🔁 Lifecycle of a Thread

A thread in Java goes through the following **life stages**:

```text
NEW → RUNNABLE → RUNNING → BLOCKED/WAITING → TERMINATED
```

### 1. **New**
Thread object is created but not yet started.
```java
Thread t = new Thread(); // NEW
```

### 2. **Runnable**
Thread is ready to run after `start()` is called.
```java
t.start(); // RUNNABLE
```

### 3. **Running**
Thread scheduler picks the thread from the ready state and executes it.

### 4. **Blocked/Waiting**
Thread is paused and waiting to acquire a resource or waiting for a signal.

### 5. **Terminated (Dead)**
Thread has completed execution or was terminated abnormally.

## 🛠️ Methods of Thread Class

Java provides various useful methods inside the `Thread` class.

| Method               | Description |
|----------------------|-------------|
| `start()`            | Starts a new thread |
| `run()`              | Code executed by the thread |
| `sleep(ms)`          | Puts thread to sleep for given milliseconds |
| `join()`             | Waits for a thread to die |
| `yield()`            | Hints that the thread is willing to yield CPU |
| `isAlive()`          | Checks if thread is still running |
| `setPriority(int)`   | Sets thread priority |
| `getName()` / `setName(String)` | Get/Set thread name |
| `interrupt()`        | Interrupts a sleeping or waiting thread |
| `isInterrupted()`    | Checks if the thread has been interrupted |

### ✅ Example: Using Basic Thread Methods

```java
class MyThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            System.out.println(getName() + " is running: " + i);
            try {
                Thread.sleep(1000); // Thread goes to sleeping state
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                System.out.println(getName() + " was interrupted!");
            }
        }
    }
}

public class ThreadDemo {
    public static void main(String[] args) throws InterruptedException {
        MyThread t1 = new MyThread();
        t1.setName("Worker-1");
        t1.start();

        t1.join(); // Main thread waits for t1 to finish
        System.out.println("Main thread exits.");
    }
}
```

## 🔒 Thread Synchronization

### 💭 Problem:
When multiple threads access **shared resources**, **race conditions** may occur, leading to **inconsistent data**.

### ✅ Solution:
Use `synchronized` keyword to control access.

### 🔧 Synchronization Techniques:

1. **Synchronized Methods**
2. **Synchronized Blocks**
3. **Static Synchronization**

### 📌 1. Synchronized Method Example

```java
class Bank {
    int balance = 1000;

    synchronized void withdraw(int amount) {
        if (balance >= amount) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " is withdrawing...");
            balance -= amount;
            System.out.println("Balance after withdrawal: " + balance);
        } else {
            System.out.println("Insufficient balance for " + Thread.currentThread().getName());
        }
    }
}

class Customer extends Thread {
    Bank bank;

    Customer(Bank bank) {
        this.bank = bank;
    }

    public void run() {
        bank.withdraw(700);
    }
}

public class SyncExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Bank b = new Bank();
        Customer c1 = new Customer(b);
        Customer c2 = new Customer(b);
        c1.setName("Alice");
        c2.setName("Bob");

        c1.start();
        c2.start();
    }
}
```

### 📌 2. Synchronized Block Example

```java
class Printer {
    void print(String message) {
        synchronized(this) {
            for (int i = 0; i < 3; i++) {
                System.out.println(message + " - " + i);
            }
        }
    }
}

class PrintingThread extends Thread {
    Printer printer;
    String message;

    PrintingThread(Printer printer, String msg) {
        this.printer = printer;
        this.message = msg;
    }

    public void run() {
        printer.print(message);
    }
}

public class SyncBlockExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Printer p = new Printer();
        Thread t1 = new PrintingThread(p, "Thread1");
        Thread t2 = new PrintingThread(p, "Thread2");
        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

---

### 📌 3. Static Synchronization

Used when multiple threads access a **static synchronized method**, which locks the **class**, not the object.

```java
class Utility {
    public static synchronized void printNumbers() {
        for (int i = 1; i <= 3; i++) {
            System.out.println(Thread.currentThread().getName() + " - " + i);
        }
    }
}

class StaticSyncThread extends Thread {
    public void run() {
        Utility.printNumbers();
    }
}

public class StaticSyncExample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Thread t1 = new StaticSyncThread();
        Thread t2 = new StaticSyncThread();

        t1.start();
        t2.start();
    }
}
```

## 💡 Summary

- **Threads** are lightweight and used for multitasking within the same process.
- **Processes** are isolated execution environments with separate memory.
- The **lifecycle of a thread** includes states like new, runnable, running, waiting, and terminated.
- Java provides many **Thread class methods** to control and monitor threads.
- **Thread synchronization** is critical when multiple threads access shared resources.
