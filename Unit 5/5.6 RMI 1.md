# üì° Introduction to Java RMI (Remote Method Invocation)

Java **RMI (Remote Method Invocation)** allows an object to **invoke methods on another object running in a different JVM**, possibly on a different machine. It's like **calling a local method**, but it actually runs remotely.

---

## üåç What is Java RMI?

Java RMI lets you build **distributed applications** where **one object on a machine can call another object's method located on another machine**.

‚ú® It's used in:
- Distributed systems
- Remote procedure calls
- Client-server architectures

üí° **Key Feature**: It abstracts network communication into **simple Java method calls**.

## üõ†Ô∏è RMI Architecture Overview

The RMI system consists of several components:

```
[Client JVM]                          [Server JVM]
    |                                      |
    |---> Stub (client proxy)              |
    |        |                             |
    |        |---> Request over network --->|
    |                              Skeleton (server proxy)
    |                                      |
    |<--- Return value <--- Remote Object --|
```

### Key Components:

| Component | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Remote Interface** | Declares methods that can be invoked remotely |
| **Remote Object** | Implements the remote interface |
| **Stub** | Client-side proxy that forwards method calls |
| **Skeleton** | Server-side dispatcher (used in Java RMI before Java 2 SDK; now handled internally) |
| **RMI Registry** | Service where remote objects are registered and discovered |

## üì¶ What is a Stub and Skeleton?

### üß© Stub (Client-Side Proxy)

- Acts as a **local representation of the remote object**
- Handles communication like marshalling arguments and sending them over the network
- Receives results and returns them to the client

### üß± Skeleton (Server-Side Dispatcher)

> **Deprecated in Java 2 (JDK 1.2)**

- Receives method calls from stub
- Unmarshalls data and invokes the actual method on the server object
- Sends the result back

Now, **RMI uses dynamic proxies**, so we no longer explicitly generate skeletons.

## üîó Client-Server Communication using RMI

### üîß Step-by-step Communication Process

1. **Define a Remote Interface**:
   - Must extend `java.rmi.Remote`
   - All methods must throw `RemoteException`

2. **Create the Remote Object (Implementation)**:
   - Implements the interface
   - Extends `UnicastRemoteObject`

3. **Start the RMI Registry**:
   - Can be started with `LocateRegistry.createRegistry(port)` or `rmiregistry` command

4. **Register Remote Object with Naming Service**:
   - Use `Naming.rebind("rmi://host:port/name", obj)`

5. **Client Looks Up Remote Object**:
   - Use `Naming.lookup("rmi://host:port/name")`

6. **Client Calls Remote Method**:
   - Behind the scenes, stub sends request ‚Üí server handles it ‚Üí response returned

## üß™ Example Flow: How RMI Works

Let's say we have a method `int add(int x, int y)` exposed via RMI.

### üß© Remote Interface (shared by client & server)

```java
public interface Adder extends Remote {
    int add(int x, int y) throws RemoteException;
}
```

---

### üß± Remote Object (on Server)

```java
public class AdderRemote extends UnicastRemoteObject implements Adder {
    AdderRemote() throws RemoteException {
        super();
    }

    public int add(int x, int y) {
        return x + y;
    }
}
```

---

### üñ•Ô∏è Server Code

```java
public class MyServer {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Adder stub = new AdderRemote(); // Create remote object
            LocateRegistry.createRegistry(9999); // Start registry
            Naming.rebind("rmi://localhost:9999/obj1", stub); // Bind object
            System.out.println("Server started...");
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```

---

### üë®‚Äçüíª Client Code

```java
public class MyClient {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            Adder stub = (Adder) Naming.lookup("rmi://localhost:9999/obj1");
            int result = stub.add(10, 20);
            System.out.println("Result from server: " + result);
        } catch (Exception e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
    }
}
```
