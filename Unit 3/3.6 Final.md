# **Java `final`, `finally`, and `finalize`**  

Java provides three important concepts: `final`, `finally`, and `finalize`. These are often confused, but they serve different purposes.  

---

## **1. Difference Between `final`, `finally`, and `finalize`**  

| **Aspect**        | **`final`**                                       | **`finally`**                                    | **`finalize`**                                   |
|-------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| **Definition**    | A keyword that applies restrictions on variables, methods, and classes. | A block used in exception handling to ensure execution of certain code. | A method in the `Object` class used before garbage collection. |
| **Purpose**      | Prevents modification of variables, inheritance of classes, or overriding of methods. | Ensures that a block of code runs after a `try-catch` block, regardless of an exception. | Used to clean up resources before an object is destroyed. |
| **Can be used with** | Variables, methods, and classes. | Only within a `try-catch` block. | Objects (by overriding the method in a class). |
| **Execution**    | Executes when declared. | Always executes after a `try-catch` block. | Called by the garbage collector, but execution is not guaranteed. |

## **2. `final` Keyword**  

The `final` keyword in Java is used with **variables**, **methods**, and **classes** to impose restrictions.  

### **Usage of `final`**  

| **Feature**  | **Description** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Final Variable** | Once initialized, its value **cannot be changed**. |
| **Final Method** | Cannot be **overridden** in a subclass. |
| **Final Class** | Cannot be **inherited** by other classes. |

### **Syntax**  
```java
final int a = 100; // Constant value
```

### **Example: Restricting Variable Modification**  
```java
class A {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int a = 5;       // Non-final variable
        final int b = 6; // Final variable

        a++;  // Allowed
        b++;  // Compile-time error (cannot modify final variable)
    }
}
```
**ðŸ”¹ Key Point**: Once a variable is declared as `final`, its value **cannot be changed**.  

---

## **3. `finally` Block**  

The `finally` block is always executed after a `try-catch` block, **whether an exception occurs or not**. It is mainly used for **cleanup operations** (e.g., closing files, releasing resources).  

### **Usage of `finally`**  

| **Feature**  | **Description** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Ensures Execution** | Always runs after `try-catch`, even if an exception occurs. |
| **Used for Cleanup** | Commonly used to close **files**, **database connections**, or **network sockets**. |

### **Syntax**  
```java
try {
    // Code that might throw an exception
} catch (ExceptionType e) {
    // Exception handling code
} finally {
    // Code that will always execute
}
```

### **Example: Ensuring Cleanup Execution**  
```java
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        try {
            System.out.println("Inside try block");
            int result = 10 / 0; // This will cause an exception
        } catch (ArithmeticException e) {
            System.out.println("Exception caught: " + e.getMessage());
        } finally {
            System.out.println("finally block always executes");
        }
    }
}
```
### **Output:**  
```
Inside try block  
Exception caught: / by zero  
finally block always executes  
```
**ðŸ”¹ Key Point**: The `finally` block **always executes**, ensuring important cleanup actions are performed.

## **4. `finalize()` Method**  

The `finalize()` method is used to **perform cleanup before an object is garbage collected**. It belongs to the `Object` class and can be overridden in custom classes.  

### **Usage of `finalize()`**  

| **Feature**  | **Description** |
|-------------|----------------|
| **Cleanup Before GC** | Runs before an object is removed from memory. |
| **Part of Object Class** | Can be overridden in a user-defined class. |
| **Execution Not Guaranteed** | The garbage collector **may or may not** call `finalize()`. |

### **Syntax**  
```java
protected void finalize() throws Throwable {
    // Cleanup code
}
```

### **Example: Demonstrating `finalize()`**  
```java
public class Geeks {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Geeks g = new Geeks();

        System.out.println("Hashcode is: " + g.hashCode());

        // Making object eligible for garbage collection
        g = null;
        System.gc(); // Request garbage collection

        try {
            Thread.sleep(1000); // Delay to allow GC
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
            e.printStackTrace();
        }

        System.out.println("End of garbage collection");
    }

    // Overriding finalize() method
    @Override
    protected void finalize() {
        System.out.println("Called the finalize() method");
    }
}
```
### **Output:**  
```
Hashcode is: <some integer>
Called the finalize() method
End of garbage collection
```
**ðŸ”¹ Key Point**: `finalize()` is called **before an object is destroyed**, but its execution is **not guaranteed**.

## **5. Summary of `final`, `finally`, and `finalize`**  

| **Feature**    | **`final`** | **`finally`** | **`finalize`** |
|---------------|------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Purpose**   | Restricts modification/inheritance. | Ensures execution after `try-catch`. | Cleans up before garbage collection. |
| **Usage**     | Variables, methods, classes. | Exception handling (`try-catch`). | Objects (by overriding method). |
| **Execution** | When declared. | Always after `try-catch`. | When GC decides (not guaranteed). |
